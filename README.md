# Reconstruction-of-Trajectory-with-Missing-Markers

The project deals with implementing various Neural Network approaches to perform the reconstruction of missing markers in the human motion capture data and as a result finding the one which gives the most accurate recreation.

# Human Motion Capture Data

The pre-processed human motion capture data as well as the base code were extracted from [A Neural Network Approach to Missing Marker Reconstruction](https://github.com/Svito-zar/NN-for-Missing-Marker-Reconstruction). In order to use your own Motion Capture data, follow the steps in the Data Preparation section of *A Neural Network Approach to Missing Marker Reconstruction* repository.
